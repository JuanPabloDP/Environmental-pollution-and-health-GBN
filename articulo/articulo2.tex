\section{Introduction}
Climate change and air pollution are known to pose critical challenges when it comes to public health. In particular, exposition to gases such as nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and fine particulate matter have been linked to diminished biological biomarkers which are associated with cardiovascular risk, inflammation, and respiratory function. In Mexico, environmental pollution remains a significant health concern, and several measures have been taken in an attempt to mitigate the associated risks as much as possible. However, some of these dangers are not fully understood, and neither are the ways to counteract them.
Given that these contaminants interact with each other in intricate ways, complex relationships emerge which, in turn,  lend themselves to analysis via Gaussian Bayesian networks. 
In particular,

Exposure to air pollutants such as SO$_2$, CO, NOx, VOCs, PM$_{10}$, PM$_{2.5}$, and NH$_3$ has a direct impact on various biomarkers related to respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic health. The main effects include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Particulate matter (PM$_{10}$ and PM$_{2.5}$):} Penetrate the lungs and bloodstream, contributing to systemic inflammation. Key biomarkers affected include C-reactive protein, ferritin , homocysteine, and lipid profiles.
    
    \item \textbf{Carbon monoxide (CO):} Reduces oxygen transport, leading to hypoxia and affecting hemoglobin  and creatinine levels, as well as inflammatory markers.
    
    \item \textbf{Nitrogen oxides (NOx):} Promote vascular inflammation and accelerate atherosclerosis.Biomarkers impacted include C-reactive protein,LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, glucose, and insulin levels.
    
    \item \textbf{Sulfur dioxide (SO$_2$):} Irritates the respiratory tract and, when converted to sulfates, increases lung and cardiovascular damage. Associated biomarkers include C-reactive protein, triglycerides, cholesterol, and hemoglobin.
    
    \item \textbf{Volatile organic compounds (VOCs):} Affect liver and kidney function, altering creatinine and uric acid levels, as well as inflammatory biomarkers.
    
    \item \textbf{Ammonia (NH$_3$):} Contributes to respiratory and metabolic disorders such as asthma and kidney stress, impacting creatinine, hemoglobin, and micronutrient biomarkers.
\end{itemize}

Overall, exposure to these pollutants negatively affects multiple systems in the human body, increasing risks for metabolic, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases, with potential serious health consequences.
